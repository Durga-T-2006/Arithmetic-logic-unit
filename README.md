##DESCRIPTION OF MY TASK - As part of the CODTECH Internship Task-1, to design a basic Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) using Verilog HDL. This task focused on implementing a simple yet functional ALU that supports

five key operations: Addition, Subtraction, AND, OR, and NOT. The design process began with understanding the behavior of each operation and how to efficiently represent them in Verilog. The ALU was designed to

accept two input operands (A and B), a operation selector (OP), and produce a output result (Y) along with basic flags like zero and carry (optional extension).After coding the ALU logic in

Verilog, I developed a comprehensive testbench to validate the functionality of each operation. The testbench applied multiple test vectors to simulate real-time inputs and ensure accurate results for all

supported functions.For simulation and verification, I used ModelSim, a powerful HDL simulation tool.

ModelSim allowed me to:

Compile and simulate Verilog code.

Visualize waveform outputs to trace the internal signal changes.

The simulation results confirmed that the ALU correctly executed all specified operations. Waveform analysis in ModelSim verified the proper transition of outputs corresponding to each input case, ensuring

functional accuracy.

Deliverables:

Verilog code for the ALU.

Verilog testbench for simulation.

Simulation report including waveform snapshots and result logs.
